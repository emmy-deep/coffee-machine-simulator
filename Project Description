☕ Full Project Description: Automated Coffee and Tea Ordering System (C Language)
The Automated Coffee and Tea Ordering System is a console-based program written in C language that simulates the working of a small vending machine for beverages. It is an interactive, menu-driven system that allows customers to order different types of drinks such as Hot Coffee, Cold Coffee, Simple Tea, and Masala Tea, along with customization options like cup size, milk preference, sugar quantity, and number of cups.
The main objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly ordering experience while demonstrating the use of core C programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, input/output operations, and basic arithmetic processing.
🎯 Key Features
Menu-based selection for beverages.
Customizable options — users can select cup size (S, M, L), milk (Yes/No), and sugar level (0–5 tsp).
Automatic billing system that calculates the total price based on selections and number of cups.
Payment and change calculation — customers can enter the amount and receive change if applicable.
Input validation — prevents invalid entries like negative cups or out-of-range sugar values.
Customer feedback collection using fgets() for string input.
Multi-customer support through a do-while loop for continuous transactions.
Session summary and graceful exit after the last customer.
🧩 Technical Overview
Programming Language: C
File Extension: .c
Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / Code::Blocks IDE
Paradigm: Procedural programming
Main Concepts Used:
Conditional statements (if, else if, switch)
Loops (do-while, for)
Input validation and error handling
String handling (fgets, printf)
Arithmetic calculations
⚙️ System Workflow
Display the drink menu.
Take user input (drink type, cup size, milk, sugar, and number of cups).
Validate all inputs to avoid invalid entries.
Calculate total bill based on selections.
Prompt user to enter money for payment.
Display balance/change if any.
Collect customer feedback.
Ask if there is another customer.
Repeat or exit the program gracefully.
